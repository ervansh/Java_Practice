/**
 * LinkedList is a class which is implemented in the collection framework which
 * inherently implements the linked list data structure. It is a linear data
 * structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every
 * element is a separate object with a data part and address part. The elements
 * are linked using pointers and addresses. Each element is known as a node. Due
 * to the dynamicity and ease of insertions and deletions, they are preferred
 * over the arrays. Letâ€™s see how to create a list object using this class.
